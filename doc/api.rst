API
===

What's that?
------------

It's a way to read or write data to eLabFTW from an external program (like a Python script).

For instance, instead of using a web browser to access the web interface and create an experiment,
you make a call to the API saying "hey, create an experiment for me", and the api will reply with the ID of the newly created experiment.

Documentation
-------------

The complete documentation of all endpoints with code examples is available here: `elabftw's API documentation <https://doc.elabftw.net/api/>`_.
