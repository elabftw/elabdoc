Environment installation
````````````````````````

So the dev environment for eLab is an hybrid between Docker and a local install. The files will be served by the webserver in Docker but the source code (`elabftw` folder) will be on your computer. In this setup, we will put everything in the same folder for simplicity.

Here is a step-by-step for installing an eLabFTW dev setup:

* First we install the dependencies:

  * `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_
  * `Docker Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_

Make sure your user is in the `docker` group so you can execute docker commands without sudo (see `documentation <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/>`_).

* Next let's define a directory for dev (adapt to your needs):

.. code-block:: bash

    # this folder can be anywhere you like
    export dev='/home/<YOUR USERNAME>/elabdev'
    mkdir -p $dev
    cd $dev

* Go on `the repository on GitHub <https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw>`_
* Click the Star button (it helps with visibility of the project)
* Click the Fork button in the top right of the screen
* From your fork page, clone it with SSH on your machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Note: we clone the hypernext branch because this is where dev happens
    git clone -b hypernext git@github.com:<YOUR USERNAME>/elabftw.git

* Get *elabctl* and the configuration files

.. code-block:: bash

    # get elabctl
    wget -qO- https://get.elabftw.net > elabctl && chmod +x elabctl
    # get elabctl configuration file
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabctl/master/elabctl.conf
    # get the docker-compose configuration file
    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabimg/dev/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE > elabftw-dev.yml

* Edit `elabctl.conf`, change BACKUP_DIR to `$dev/backup` or any other directory (write full paths of course, not aliases)
* Change CONF_FILE to `$dev/elabftw-dev.yml`. Again, write the full path, not the alias!
* Change DATA_DIR to `$dev/data`. Again, write the full path, not the alias!
* Edit the docker-compose configuration file `elabftw-dev.yml`
* Add a SECRET_KEY
* Change the `volumes:` line so it points to your `$dev/elabftw` folder (for elabftw and mysql containers)
* Start the containers:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./elabctl start


.. note::

    PHP dependencies are managed through `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`_. It'll read the `composer.lock` file and install packages (see `composer.json`). Javascript dependencies are managed through `Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/>`_. It'll read the `yarn.lock` file and install packages (see `package.json`). The `yarn install` command will populate the `node_modules` directory, and the `buildall` command will use `Webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>_` to create bundles (see `builder.js` file) and then `Grunt <https://gruntjs.com/>`_ to minify some CSS and JS files (see `Gruntfile.js`).

* Now install the PHP and JavaScript dependencies using `composer` and `yarn` shipped with the container:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $dev/elabftw
    # php dependencies (vendor/ directory)
    docker exec -it elabftw composer install
    # javascript dependencies (node_modules/ directory)
    docker exec -it elabftw yarn install && yarn run buildall

* Enable debug mode to disable the caching of Twig templates

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it mysql bash
    # you are now inside the mysql container
    mysql -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD $MYSQL_DATABASE
    # you are now on the mysql command line
    mysql> update config set conf_value = '1' where conf_name = 'debug';
    exit;
    exit

* Now head to https://localhost:3148
* You now should have a running local eLabFTW, and changes made to the code will be immediatly visible

Making a pull request
`````````````````````
#. Before working on a feature, it's a good idea to open an issue first to discuss its implementation
#. Create a branch from **hypernext**
#. Work on a feature
#. Make a pull request on GitHub to include it in **hypernext**

.. code-block:: bash

    cd $dev/elabftw
    # create your feature branch from the hypernext branch
    git checkout -b my-feature
    # modify the code, commit and push to your fork
    # go to github.com and create a pull request

Code organization
`````````````````
* Real accessible pages are in the web/ directory (experiments.php, database.php, login.php, etcâ€¦)
* The rest is in app/ or src/ for PHP classes
* src/models will contain classes with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy)
* src/classes will contain services or utility classes
* A new class will be loaded automagically thanks to the use of PSR-4 with composer (namespace Elabftw\\Elabftw)
* app/controllers will contain pages that send actions to models (like destroy something), and generally output json for an ajax request, or redirect the user.
* Check out the scripts in `src/tools` too

Miscellaneous
`````````````
* if you make a change to the SQL stucture, you need to add an update function in `src/classes/Update.php` and also modify `src/sql/structure.sql` and `tests/_data/phpunit.sql` accordingly
* comment your code wisely
* your code must follow `the PSR standards <https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md>`_
* add a plugin to your editor to show trailing whitespaces in red
* add a plugin to your editor to show PSR-1 errors
* remove BOM
* if you want to work on the documentation, clone the `elabdoc repo <https://github.com/elabftw/elabdoc>`_
* if you want to make backups of your dev install, you'll need to edit `/etc/elabctl.conf` to point to the correct folders/config files. See `example <https://github.com/elabftw/elabctl/blob/master/elabctl.conf>`_
* in php camelCase; in html, dash separation for css stuff, camelCase for JS

Glossary
````````
* Experiments + Database items = Entities. So when you see Entity it means it can be an experiment or a database item

Build
`````
The javascript and css files are stored unminified in the source code. But the app uses the minified versions, so if you make a change to the javascript or css files, you need to rebuild them. An alternative is to edit the template and load the "src" version instead of the ".min" one. This way you can edit and reload directly without having to compile each time.

* To minify files:

.. code-block:: bash

    # install the packages first
    yarn install
    yarn run buildall

Other commands exist, see `builder.js` (webpack), the `scripts` part of `package.json` (yarn) and `Gruntfile.js` (grunt).

Tests
`````

The tests run on the Codeception framework. The acceptance tests will need to download the Selenium + Chrome headless docker image.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ yarn run unit # will run the unit tests
    $ yarn run test # will run the unit and acceptance tests

For code coverage you need to enable the xdebug PHP extension and run `yarn run coverage`.

API Documentation
`````````````````
To get a good view of the relations between the classes, get `phpDocumentor <https://phpdoc.org>`_ and make sure you can execute it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar
    $ chmod +x phpDocumentor.phar
    $ sudo mv phpDocumentor.phar /usr/local/bin/phpDocumentor

To generate a PHP Docblock documentation:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ yarn run srcdoc

Then, point your browser to the `_srcdoc/index.html`.

You can have a look at the errors report to check that you commented all new functions properly.

To generate the documentation for the API, you'll need `apidoc <http://apidocjs.com/>`_, install it first:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ yarn install -g apidoc

Make sure the npm `bin` folder is in your $PATH.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ yarn run apidoc

Then, point your browser to the `_apidoc/index.html`.

Exceptions handling
-------------------

Here are some ground rules for exceptions thrown in the code:

* Code should not throw a generic Exception, but one of Elabftw\Exceptions
* ImproperActionException when something forbidden happens but it's not suspicious. Error is not logged, and message is shown to user
* DatabaseErrorException when a SQL query failed, the error is logged and message is shown to user
* IllegalActionException when something should not happen in normal conditions unless someone is poking around by editing the requests. Error is logged and generic permission error is shown
* FilesystemErrorException, same as DatabaseErrorException but for file operations
* For the rest, the error is logged and a generic error message is shown to user
* Code should throw an Exception as soon as something goes wrong
* Exceptions should not be catched in the code (models), only in the controllers
* Instead of returning bool, functions should throw exception if something goes wrong. This removes the need to check for return value in consuming code (something often forgotten!)

Making a gif
------------

* make a capture with xvidcap, it outputs .xwd

* convert .xwd to gif:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ convert -define registry:temporary-path=/path/tmp -limit memory 2G \*.xwd out.gif
    # or another way to do it, this will force to write all to disk
    $ export MAGICK_TMPDIR=/path/to/disk/with/space
    $ convert -limit memory 0 -limit map 0 \*.xwd out.gif

* generate a palette with ffmpeg:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ffmpeg -i out.gif -vf fps=10,scale=600:-1:flags=lanczos,palettegen palette.png

* make a lighter gif:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ffmpeg -i out.gif -i palette.png -filter_complex "fps=10,scale=320:-1:flags=lanczos[x];[x][1:v]paletteuse" out-final.gif

* upload to original one to gfycat and the smaller one to imgur

Updating tinymce
----------------

* edit package.json and increment version
* yarn install && grunt
* rm -r app/js/{plugins,skins,themes}
* cp -r node_modules/tinymce/{plugins,skins,themes} app/js
* cp -r node_modules/tinymce-mention/mention app/js/plugins/
