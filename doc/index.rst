Introduction
============

eLabFTW is a PHP application using MySQL to store data persistently. Once installed on a server, users can register an account and start using their electronic lab notebook.

Several teams can be hosted on the same install. Ideally, it is installed at the institution/company level. But individual teams can install it for themselves, too. Or you can run it locally on your computer.

It is distributed through Docker images, ensuring portability and added security. See the :doc:`Docker documentation <docker-doc>` for more infos.

Check out the :doc:`list of features <features>`.

See :doc:`this page <install>` to install it on your server.

See :doc:`this page <install-cloud>` if you don't own a server already.
