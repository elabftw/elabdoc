How to update

.. warning:: Be sure to `read the release notes <https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/latest>`_, they might contain important information. And have a :ref:`backup <backup>`.

.. note:: If you are running out of disk space, you can do "docker system prune -a" to free up some space taken by old images.

STEP 0: Before the update
=========================

Make sure to figure out what version you are running and **read the release notes** for the new version.

The current running version can be seen in the bottom right of every page.

.. warning:: Be sure to `read the release notes <https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/latest>`_, they might contain important information. And have a :ref:`backup <backup>`.

STEP 1: Specify which version you want
======================================

Start by editing your configuration file (`/etc/elabftw.yml` by default) and change the version of the image (line `image: elabftw/elabimg:X.Y.Z`)

The latest version can be found on `this page <https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/latest>`_.


STEP 2: Launch a new container
==============================

With elabctl
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    elabctl update

Without elabctl
---------------

In the directory where you have the `docker-compose.yml` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker compose pull
    docker compose down
    docker compose up -d

STEP 3: Run the database migration
==================================

.. code-block:: bash

    # change the name of the container if it is different in your configuration
    docker exec -it elabftw bin/console db:update
    # Note: for version 3.3 to 3.4 use this instead
    docker exec -it elabftw bin/console db:updateTo34
    # Note: for version 2.x to 3.x use this instead
    docker exec -it elabftw bin/console db:updateto3

Congratulations, you are now running the latest version! Make sure to keep your installation regularly updated!

If you encounter an issue during the database migration, open a GitHub issue!

Note that you can use `db:revert XYZ` to revert the changes made by schema `XYZ`, or use `--force` to ignore errors (only do that if you know what you are doing!).

Updating from incredibly old versions
=====================================

If you are running eLabFTW version <3.4.0 (from March 2020), you'll want to run ``db:updateto34`` after upgrading to 3.4.0 (again, always read the release notes from the version you're targeting).

If you are running eLabFTW version <3.0.0 (from April 2019), you'll want to run ``db:updateto3`` after upgrading to 3.0.0.

If you are running eLabFTW version <2.0.7 (from December 2018), you'll want to update more often so you're not stuck with an incredibly outdated software application.
