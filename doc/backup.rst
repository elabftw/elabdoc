How to backup
=============

This page shows you how to backup an existing elabftw installation. It is important that you take the time to make sure that your backups are working properly.

There is basically three things to backup :

* the MySQL database
* your `config.php` file (unless you're using Docker and you want the `/etc/elabftw.yml` file)
* the uploaded files (in `uploads/` folder)

Using elabctl
-------------

If you installed eLabFTW with elabctl, making a backup becomes very easy. Issue this command as root:

.. code-block:: bash

    elabctl backup

.. warning::

   If you get this error: `mysqldump: Error: 'Access denied; you need (at least one of) the PROCESS privilege(s) for this operation' when trying to dump tablespaces`
   Update your elabctl with "elabctl self-update" (might need to prepend sudo depending on where you installed it)

Using a script
--------------

You'll want to have a little script that do the backup automatically.
Here is one way to do it. Adapt it to your needs: `see script <https://gist.github.com/NicolasCARPi/5d9e2599857a148a54b0>`_.

If you don't remember your SQL user/password, look in the `config.php` file!

Make sure to synchronize your files to another computer. Because backuping to the same machine is only half useful.

Making it automatic using cron
------------------------------

A good backup is automatic.

If you're under a GNU/Linux system, try::

    export EDITOR=nano ; crontab -e

This will open a file:

.. image:: img/crontab.png

Add this line at the bottom::

    00 04 * * * bash /path/to/backup.sh
    or
    00 04 * * * elabctl backup

This will run the script everyday at 4am.

How to backup a Docker installation
-----------------------------------

With elabctl
````````````
If you installed eLabFTW with `elabctl <https://github.com/elabftw/elabctl>`_, use:

.. code-block:: bash

    elabctl backup

Without elabctl
```````````````
* Copy the `/etc/elabftw.yml` somewhere safe.
* Copy the `/var/elabftw` folder somewhere safe (make a zip or tar archive).
* Backup the MySQL database:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it mysql bash -c 'mysqldump --no-tablespaces -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD -r dump.sql $MYSQL_DATABASE'
    docker cp mysql:dump.sql elabftw-$(date --iso-8601).sql
    gzip --best elabftw-$(date --iso-8601).sql

How to restore a backup
-----------------------

You should have two files to start with. Those files are the ones generated by `elabctl backup` command:

* mysql_dump-YYYY-MM-DD.sql.gz
* uploaded_files-YYYY-MM-DD.zip

Let's start by moving uploaded files and config file at the correct place:

.. code-block:: bash

    unzip uploaded_files-YYYY-MM-DD.zip
    mv var/elabftw/web/* /var/elabftw/web
    mv etc/elabftw.yml /etc/elabftw.yml
    # now fix the permissions
    chown -R 100:101 /var/elabftw/web
    chmod 600 /etc/elabftw.yml

Now we import the SQL database (the mysql container must be running):

.. code-block:: bash

    gunzip mysql_dump-YYYY-MM-DD.sql.gz # uncompress the file
    docker cp mysql_dump-YYYY-MM-DD.sql mysql:/ # copy it inside the mysql container
    docker exec -it mysql bash # spawn a shell in the mysql container
    mysql -uroot -p # login to mysql prompt
    # here you type the password you put in MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD in the /etc/elabftw.yml file
    Mysql> drop database elabftw; # delete the brand new database
    Mysql> create database elabftw character set utf8mb4 collate utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci; # create a new one
    Mysql> use elabftw; # select it
    Mysql> set names utf8; # make sure you import in utf8 (don't do this if you are in latin1)
    Mysql> source mysql_dump-YYYY-MM-DD.sql; # import the backup
    Mysql> exit;

Now you should have your old install back :)


How to backup a NAS
-------------------

If you've installed elabftw on a NAS, you don't have `elabctl` nor a config file. So you'll need to issue the commands manually (you can make a script after of course).

So the first thing is to create a folder where you'll put the backups:

.. code-block:: bash

    export BACKUP_FOLDER=/path/to/your/backup/folder
    mkdir -p $BACKUP_FOLDER

Next we'll save the database:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec mysql bash -c 'mysqldump --no-tablespaces -u$MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_PASSWORD -r dump.sql $MYSQL_DATABASE'

The environment variables will be correctly replaced; convenient, isn't it? So just copy paste this and it'll work.

Next we copy the `dump.sql` file out of the container, and move it to our backup place:

.. code-block:: bash

    export DUMP_FILE=${BACKUP_FOLDER}/$(date --iso-8601)-dump.sql
    docker cp mysql:dump.sql $DUMP_FILE
    # compress it
    gzip -f --best $DUMP_FILE

Finally we make a zip of the uploaded files:

.. code-block:: bash

    export ZIP_FILE=${BACKUP_FOLDER}/$(date --iso-8601)-uploaded_files.zip
    zip -rq "$ZIP_FILE" /path/to/elabftw/files/web -x /path/to/elabftw/files/web/tmp\*

I'm not sure if you can export the config of the containers from the GUI menu. So maybe take a screenshot or save it manually. Worst case scenario if you lose completely this config it's not a big deal.

Put all of the above in a script so you can run it easily next time (make a cronjob if possible). See the backup function of elabctl: https://github.com/elabftw/elabctl/blob/master/elabctl.sh#L40 for inspiration.
