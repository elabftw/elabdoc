Breaking changes:
`````````````````

* Completely drop support for non-Docker installation method, `see why <https://doc.elabftw.net/docker-doc.html#why-can-t-i-run-it-outside-docker>`_.
* Require MySQL version 8.0. If you are running MySQL version 5.7 or earlier, you might run into encoding issues. One workaround would be to export your data, do the mysql upgrade and re-import your data in UTF-8.
* A new mandatory configuration option (environment variable) `SITE_URL` is needed. Edit your configuration file (`/etc/elabftw.yml` by default) and add a new environment variable `SITE_URL` with a value that corresponds to the address for the instance (including the port if not custom). If this value is not set, the container will not start. This was previously an optional setting in the instance main config, but it was causing issues, see #3319. (PR #3323). Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   SITE_URL=https://elab.example.org



Important changes:

Release notes:

This new version brings a few bugfixes and a lot of new features and enhancements. The "Favorite tags" feature will hopefully be quite useful to a number of users that wanted a folder-like interface. There are also two security fixes in there, and while they probably won't impact the majority of users, are worth updating for.

Breaking changes:

No breaking changes from 4.0.11, update like usual.

Important changes for SAML users:

* Some settings that were in the "SP" part are now attached to the IDP. This means you can now configure different IDP with different values for expected "email", "team", "firstname" and "lastname" attributes.

BREAKING CHANGES:
`````````````````

For both Docker and non-Docker users
````````````````````````````````````

Minimum MySQL version is 5.7.8 (due to the use of the JSON datatype).

For Docker users
````````````````

* It appears that the UID/GID for uploaded files needs to be changed. For most users this means:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo chown -R 101:101 /path/to/elabftw/web

Where the path points to the folder where uploaded files are stored. If you used in your configuration file a different UID/GID, use this instead of course.

For non-Docker users
````````````````````

* A domain/subdomain is required, subfolder installation are not supported anymore due to several hard to catch bugs and issues
* PHP Version 8.0 is required
* Install imagick PECL extension and remove gmagick extension. gmagick will be used if imagick is not found (with a fallback to gd).
* The config line for the API has changed slightly. The new nginx config block is:

.. code-block:: nginx

   location ~ ^/api/v1/(.*)/?$ {
       rewrite /api/v1/(.*)$ /app/controllers/ApiController.php?req=$uri&args=$args last;
   }

I don't know the config line for Apache and honestly don't care enough to look into it.

Version 3.6.0
-------------

Here it is, the 3.6 branch featuring LDAP and 2FA authentication!

Possibly breaking change:

Due to a weird naming convention in Swiftmailer, the library used to send emails, it is possible that you will need to change the port for the SMTP server. This probably won't impact you as what you are probably doing now is using STARTTLS on a TLS capable port.

See #2229 for more information. Test emails after upgrading.

Version 3.5.0
-------------

This is a major update. After updating the container, you will need to run the update script:

.. code-block:: bash

   # with docker
   docker exec -it elabftw bin/console db:update
   # without docker
   php bin/console db:update

**Breaking changes**:

If you are using Docker (and you should :p), the access and error logs are now sent to stdout and stderr of the container. So if you were using `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` to store the logs, you will now need to use `docker logs elabftw` to see them. Use `docker logs elabftw 1>/dev/null` to see only errors and `docker logs elabftw 2>/dev/null` to see only access log. This change was done to align with docker best practices and should facilitate central logging.

**New features**:

* Enforce read/write permissions of experiments by Admin (#1999)
* The Todolist is now also showing the unfinished steps in experiments (#2024)
* The Todolist will stay open on page change
* External authentication (contributed by @manu0401) (PR #2023). If the webserver is providing authentication, use this to login the user. Also provide an URL for logout. Add parameters in Sysconfig page to configure external auth
* Add proper Single Log Out (#1691)
* Steps on experiments are now sortable and editable (#904)
* Add pinned entities. A pinned experiment or item will stay on top of the page in show mode
* Add Ctrl+= and Ctrl+Shift+= for subscript/superscript (#1556)
* Add JSON export from show mode
* Generate a single PDF file with all selected items (PR #2038) (#434) Contribution by Marcel Bolten
* Show related items in view/edit mode (PR #1993) (#1432) Contribution by Marcel Bolten
* Allow file upload with copy/past (PR #1886) Contribution by Sherjeel Shabih
* Display a link to the scheduler on experiments bound to a scheduler event
* Order the links by name (#1940)
* Add template permissions similar to exp/items permissions (PR #1885) (#1668) Contribution by Max Schröder and Farrukh Faizy

**Bugfixes**:

* Fix wrong IDP used when several active IDPs were configured
* Fix potential issues spotted by static analysis
* Fix count of experiments in report (#2025)

**Updates**:

* Update prismjs

**Docker**:

* Add possibility so configure a user and group for nginx. This is useful if you're using a server picky about users (using NFSv4 for instance). A contribution by François Prud'homme.

**Developer corner**:

* Add Elabftw\Maps\Team and UserPreferences. Maps are classes that map their properties to columns in a table. This is a work-in-progress.
* Add Elabftw\Elabftw\DisplayParams to store order/query/limit/offset/sort of show mode
* Make a single JS bundle instead of one per page and use "defer" to load it
  before: 6141134 bytes of JS
  after: 5560564 bytes of JS
* Overall code quality improved. Previous rating on scrutinizer-ci was 8.7, it is now 9.09!

Version 2.0.0
-------------

WARNING: BREAKING CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE!

Please read carefully these notes before upgrading your installation.

For Docker users: because you chose to use Docker, you have absolutely nothing to do, you can upgrade, sit back and relax. That's the advantage of using Docker: even if I move everything around in the image, for you it's transparent!

For non-Docker users: you need to perform manual steps in order to get your installation up and running for version 2.0.0. See the `Complete upgrade guide from 1.8.x to 2.0.0` on the :ref:`How to update <how-to-update>` page.

Why this update?
````````````````
Sometimes, you have to break things to make them better. With the version 2 I can remove support for php 5.6, allowing me to use the latest versions of some dependencies, and also type hinting, a new feature of the PHP language. I can move the web served directory to a separate directory that is not the root directory of the repo. This means the `uploads` folder is not in the webdir anymore which is better for several reasons. I can update different components to a major version (bootstrap, twig), use Webpack to deal better with the Javascripts, remove all the minified files from the git tracking. This means more work to install it without Docker, but the Docker method being the recommended one it's ok. It also means the repository is smaller and faster to clone. So basically with 2.0 I felt free to break everything and then rebuild it better after, without having to worry about anything (as long as I can write a proper upgrade documentation for non docker users!).

What changed?

  .. code-block:: bash

      cd /path/to/elabftw
      git pull
      rm -rf vendor # only for this time
      # see https://getcomposer.org to install composer
      composer install --no-dev

  Read the :ref:`new way to update here <how-to-update>`.

* **IMPORTANT CHANGE N°2**:

WARNING DOCKER USERS!!!!! IMPORTANT READ BELOW:

Once you pull the new version and visit a page, the config file will be updated with a new secret key. You need to copy it from inside the container to your docker-compose.yml file!

1. Use `docker ps` to check the ID of the container (or use its name)

2. Replace $ID from the below command with your container ID (or name). This command will extract the new key and place it at the end of your config file.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it $ID grep SECRET /elabftw/config.php| awk -F \' '{print $4}' >> docker-compose.yml

3. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to replace the old SECRET_KEY value by the new one at the end of the file.

Like shown on this image:

.. image:: img/1.2.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: update config

For normal users (no docker):

If you have a message asking you to make your config file readable, use this: `chmod 777 config.php`. Execute this command from inside the `elabftw` folder.
Refresh the page to retry. You can put back restrictive permissions after the update is done.

This update is a major update from the php-encryption project. So we need to change how the key is. This key is used to encrypt the SMTP and timestamping passwords.

  * Timestamping with openssl has a bug! So we use Java.
