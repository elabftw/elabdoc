Version 5.1.5
-------------

* bug/major: saml: prevent empty Name attribute for requested attributes

  In the SP Metadata XML (/metadata.php), a change has recently been made
  to use the user defined attributes, instead of hardcoding them. But in
  some case, the value was empty, not null, but an empty string, so the
  Name attribute would be empty, and Shibboleth software that regularly
  parses SP metadata would choke on it and everything would explode.

  This change prevents having an empty Name attribute for the requested
  attributes in SP metadata.

* bug/medium: saml: user identity attributes update during saml

  When using SAML auth, if the parameter "Allow users to change their
  first name, last name, or email address" was inactive (not default),
  then the user would encounter an error because the app would try and
  update the user but have no right to do so.

  This is fixed by making the update() method of Users public and using it
  for trusted calls, and moving this check into the patch() method.

* bug/medium: fix a bug preventing custom ``MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`` or ``MAX_UPLOAD_TIME`` to be set (fix #5232)
* bug/minor: fix save button from toolbar not working for templates
* bug/minor: improve handling of incorrect parameters when creating an upload: provide better error messages
* bug/minor: tags: better handling of null tag in post request
* bug/minor: items_types: add missing order by ordering in readAll()
* bug/feat: allow switching editor from resources categories (PR #5234 fix #4810)
* bug/minor: fix issue with incorrect blog post link
* security: force use of path-to-regexp 1.9.0
* i18n: update german translations (thanking Lauritz Bu√üfeld for his help!)

Version 5.1.4
-------------

* bug/medium: fix anonymous access
  The missing value for "scope_teamgroups" user setting of anonymous user was causing a major error and preventing the page from loading. fix #5231
* bug/minor: fix warning with access_key being null
* bug/minor: duplicate: fix tags not duplicated for experiments

Version 5.1.1
-------------

Version 5.1.0
-------------

Noteworthy changes
``````````````````
* Authentication cookies will now be set for users logged with SAML if the instance configuration allows for setting them. Previously, SAML authenticated user would be logged out after closing the browser, now they will have cookies to stay logged in, but only if the instance configuration allows them. (PR #5136 fix #5135). See settings in Security tab of Sysconfig panel.
* Improvements with .eln files: .eln archives can now contain a mix of experiments, resources or templates. Exporting an entry in .eln will also include any link they have, and the link of the links too. Importing a .eln will correctly create all entries, too, and honor the links. See new API endpoints `api/v2/exports` and `api/v2/import`.
* Audit event emitted in PHP logs is now a JSON string

Breaking API v2 changes
```````````````````````
* `/team_tags` has moved to `teams/{id}/tags`. If you have scripts using `/team_tags`, replace it with `teams/current/tags` to get the same behaviour.
* The POST action for Revisions endpoint has been removed. Revisions are created by changing the entry content, so it doesn't make sense to expose this action publicly.


New features
````````````

* See documentation for :ref:`Import <importing-data>`

* Add a CSV report button in Admin panel, similar to what the sysadmin has already
* Resources categories (aka `items_types`) now properly honor the permissions, which makes them shareable across teams. Previously they were limited to the team that created them. (fix #5162 via PR #5220)

Enhancements
````````````
* Allow uploading very big files (> 3 Gb) on S3: increase part size for multipart uploads (PR #5137 fix #5133)

Version 5.0.4
-------------

Bugfix patch:

* use max-height:100% in body_view. fix issue #5003
* fix profile statistics and team groups (#4963)
* fix query example in api doc (#5002)
* fix issue with month long bookings in scheduler (#4991)

Version 5.0.3
-------------

Small bugfix patch (#4968).

* fix issue where an entry could not be accessed in edit mode if these two conditions were true:

  - entry (Experiment or Resource) has a file attachment created before version 4.3.0
  - user has the uploads section display mode set to "table" (non-default)

This is a good opportunity to remind you of the existence of ``docker exec -it elabftw bin/console uploads:check`` which will ensure (for non-S3 setups) that all stored files have a ``filesize`` value in MySQL. While not strictly necessary to operate, running this command will stop eLab from falling back to reading the value from disk (because it is now available in MySQL), and that means less disk access, which is always good (looking up the filesize on an ext4 filesystem is not expensive, but it doesn't hurt to avoid it).


Version 5.0.2
-------------

Small bugfix patch.

* fix bug with custom id value that could not be removed
* fix csv report missing has_mfa_enabled column header
* fix: prevent deleted user linked in metadata from causing error

Version 5.0.1
-------------

Small bugfix patch.

* fix issue with empty Users extra field. fix #4946
* fix issue with sysadmin could not promote user to admin if not admin in
* add autocomplete for metadata key input again (#4932)

Version 5.0.0
-------------

Note
````
Yes, this is a major version bump, but apart from the removal of REST API Version 1, there are no other breaking changes, so the upgrade has nothing in particular.

Breaking change
```````````````
The reason for major version bump: APIv1 is removed and will display an error message, that cannot be bypassed anymore.

Noteworthy changes
``````````````````
* The ability to disable the "Delete" button and deletion of entries by users have been removed. These settings were added before the addition of a "soft-delete" mechanism. Currently, when something is Deleted, the data is marked as being deleted, but is still present in the sql database (and can be restored easily). The disabled button resulted in bad user experience so it is now always available.
* The default memory limit for PHP has been raised from 256 Mo to 2 Gb. This has no impact if you already defined it with the env var ``MAX_PHP_MEMORY``. This will have an impact if you don't have 2 Gb of memory to allocate. In that case, set that parameter to a more fitting value.
* The way pagination works has changed, you now have a button to "Load more". This means that now the "limit" parameter is correctly respected, returning 10 entries if the limit is 10, not 11 as before. This might impact you if you have scripts expecting the old behavior.
* The escaping strategy has been changed from sanitizing input to escaping output thanks to the amazing work done by Marcel Bolten in PR #4835. This should fix issue with quotes appearing wrongly from time to time.
* ``metadata`` field in JSON output is now interpreted (no longer a string)
* The experiments are no longer shared across teams if the owner belongs to multiple teams. See complete description of the behavior: https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4908 (PR #4920 fix #4894)

New features
````````````
* Add "Custom ID" attribute to entities (see #3724)
* Allow deleting links pointing to an entry, from the entry (fix #4738)
* The "Create" button now displays Experiments Templates in a modal window before creating an experiment

* Display Status list on Dashboard (fix #4715)
* Allow transfer ownership of experiments
* Add a new set of read/write permissions to experiments templates and resources categories. Now there is one for the template itself and one for the resulting entry created from it. (#4820)
* Add a new "Scope" button to easily switch the range of things you want listed: yours only, including your team, or everything you have access to (PR #4812)
* Add ``tcl``, ``diff`` and ``vhdl`` to syntax highlighting
* Add ``bin/console uploads:check`` command to add hash and or filesize to all files

* Add instance parameter to configure the link to the Chat room in the help menu. Useful if you have your own internal chat system.
* Add a filtering input on top of templates listing to filter out results

* Set default password minimum length to 12 characters

Version 4.9.0
-------------

Breaking change
```````````````
This release contains a breaking change for users of APIv1: the response will be an error unless `apiv1_is_dead` query string is added. APIv1 support will be completely dropped in 5.0 (likely the next major version). See https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4653 for more information.

Deprecation
```````````
The format of API keys has slightly changed to work around a design issue (fix #4617). Currently the change is backward compatible, meaning that existing keys will continue to work. It is recommended to generate a new key for faster response times especially if you're not Sysadmin. Old keys with previous format are now deprecated and need to be regenerated before 5.0.

New features
````````````
* Rework of Category and Status for Experiments and Resources (see blog post: https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-490/) (PR #4614) (see discussion: https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4613)
* Api keys now show a "Last used" timestamp, so their use is recorded and it becomes easy to see if the keys are in use or can be deleted
* Add possibility for a Sysadmin to disable 2FA for a user (fix #4486 via #4646)
* Allow the preview of Markdown and Json attachments (PR #4042 by Marcel and Nico)
* Add JSON in highlighted languages selection list
* Allow linking to experiment/resource/user from Extra fields (fix #3857 via PR #4616)

Enhancements
````````````
* Flatten the `mentions` and `comments` fields in .eln export
* Title can be easily edited from view mode now
* Add `/healthcheck.php` page to check if all is alright. Other monitoring endpoints (`/nginx-status`, `/php-status`, `/healthcheck`) were not checking the MySQL access, this one does.

* Make team selection dynamic on team select page after saml login
* Make search page help translatable and fix untranslated strings (fix #4659)

Version 4.3.0
-------------

Breaking changes:
`````````````````

* Completely drop support for non-Docker installation method, `see why <https://doc.elabftw.net/docker-doc.html#why-can-t-i-run-it-outside-docker>`_.
* Require MySQL version 8.0. If you are running MySQL version 5.7 or earlier, you might run into encoding issues. One workaround would be to export your data, do the mysql upgrade and re-import your data in UTF-8.
* A new mandatory configuration option (environment variable) `SITE_URL` is needed. Edit your configuration file (`/etc/elabftw.yml` by default) and add a new environment variable `SITE_URL` with a value that corresponds to the address for the instance (including the port if not custom). If this value is not set, the container will not start. This was previously an optional setting in the instance main config, but it was causing issues, see #3319. (PR #3323). Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   SITE_URL=https://elab.example.org



Important changes:
``````````````````

* When deletion is requested, the entry isn't really deleted but its `state` is set to deleted. It is not possible anymore to actually delete something . (PR #3302)
* When an uploaded file is replaced by a new version, the previous version has its `state` changed to `archived` and is kept around.

New features:
`````````````

Version 4.2.0
-------------

Release notes:

This new version brings a few bugfixes and a lot of new features and enhancements. The "Favorite tags" feature will hopefully be quite useful to a number of users that wanted a folder-like interface. There are also two security fixes in there, and while they probably won't impact the majority of users, are worth updating for.

Breaking changes:

Breaking changes:

No breaking changes from 4.0.11, update like usual.

Important changes for SAML users:

* Some settings that were in the "SP" part are now attached to the IDP. This means you can now configure different IDP with different values for expected "email", "team", "firstname" and "lastname" attributes. Previous values are copied during upgrade to each IDP, so there is no breaking change and nothing for you to do after upgrade. (#2879)

BREAKING CHANGES:
`````````````````

For both Docker and non-Docker users
````````````````````````````````````

Minimum MySQL version is 5.7.8 (due to the use of the JSON datatype).

For Docker users
````````````````

* It appears that the UID/GID for uploaded files needs to be changed. For most users this means:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo chown -R 101:101 /path/to/elabftw/web

Where the path points to the folder where uploaded files are stored. If you used in your configuration file a different UID/GID, use this instead of course.

For non-Docker users
````````````````````

* A domain/subdomain is required, subfolder installation are not supported anymore due to several hard to catch bugs and issues
* PHP Version 8.0 is required
* Install imagick PECL extension and remove gmagick extension. gmagick will be used if imagick is not found (with a fallback to gd).
* The config line for the API has changed slightly. The new nginx config block is:

.. code-block:: nginx

   location ~ ^/api/v1/(.*)/?$ {
       rewrite /api/v1/(.*)$ /app/controllers/ApiController.php?req=$uri&args=$args last;
   }

I don't know the config line for Apache and honestly don't care enough to look into it.

Here it is, the 3.6 branch featuring LDAP and 2FA authentication!

Possibly breaking change:

Due to a weird naming convention in Swiftmailer, the library used to send emails, it is possible that you will need to change the port for the SMTP server. This probably won't impact you as what you are probably doing now is using STARTTLS on a TLS capable port.

See #2229 for more information. Test emails after upgrading.

Version 3.5.0
-------------

This is a major update. After updating the container, you will need to run the update script:

.. code-block:: bash

   # with docker
   docker exec -it elabftw bin/console db:update
   # without docker
   php bin/console db:update

**Breaking changes**:

If you are using Docker (and you should :p), the access and error logs are now sent to stdout and stderr of the container. So if you were using `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` to store the logs, you will now need to use `docker logs elabftw` to see them. Use `docker logs elabftw 1>/dev/null` to see only errors and `docker logs elabftw 2>/dev/null` to see only access log. This change was done to align with docker best practices and should facilitate central logging.

**New features**:

* Enforce read/write permissions of experiments by Admin (#1999)
* The Todolist is now also showing the unfinished steps in experiments (#2024)
* The Todolist will stay open on page change
* External authentication (contributed by @manu0401) (PR #2023). If the webserver is providing authentication, use this to login the user. Also provide an URL for logout. Add parameters in Sysconfig page to configure external auth
* Add proper Single Log Out (#1691)
* Steps on experiments are now sortable and editable (#904)
* Add pinned entities. A pinned experiment or item will stay on top of the page in show mode
* Add Ctrl+= and Ctrl+Shift+= for subscript/superscript (#1556)
* Add JSON export from show mode
* Generate a single PDF file with all selected items (PR #2038) (#434) Contribution by Marcel Bolten
* Show related items in view/edit mode (PR #1993) (#1432) Contribution by Marcel Bolten
* Allow file upload with copy/past (PR #1886) Contribution by Sherjeel Shabih
* Display a link to the scheduler on experiments bound to a scheduler event
* Order the links by name (#1940)
* Add template permissions similar to exp/items permissions (PR #1885) (#1668) Contribution by Max Schr√∂der and Farrukh Faizy
* Allow hiding a team from the register select

**Enhancements**:

* Rework the templates (#2095)

**Bugfixes**:

* Fix potential issues spotted by static analysis
* Fix count of experiments in report (#2025)

**Updates**:

* Update prismjs

**Docker**:

* Add possibility so configure a user and group for nginx. This is useful if you're using a server picky about users (using NFSv4 for instance). A contribution by Fran√ßois Prud'homme.

**Developer corner**:

* Add Elabftw\Maps\Team and UserPreferences. Maps are classes that map their properties to columns in a table. This is a work-in-progress.
* Add Elabftw\Elabftw\DisplayParams to store order/query/limit/offset/sort of show mode
* Make a single JS bundle instead of one per page and use "defer" to load it
  before: 6141134 bytes of JS
  after: 5560564 bytes of JS
* Overall code quality improved. Previous rating on scrutinizer-ci was 8.7, it is now 9.09!

Version 2.0.0
-------------

WARNING: BREAKING CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE!

Please read carefully these notes before upgrading your installation.

For Docker users: because you chose to use Docker, you have absolutely nothing to do, you can upgrade, sit back and relax. That's the advantage of using Docker: even if I move everything around in the image, for you it's transparent!

For non-Docker users: you need to perform manual steps in order to get your installation up and running for version 2.0.0. See the `Complete upgrade guide from 1.8.x to 2.0.0` on the :ref:`How to update <how-to-update>` page.

Why this update?
````````````````
Sometimes, you have to break things to make them better. With the version 2 I can remove support for php 5.6, allowing me to use the latest versions of some dependencies, and also type hinting, a new feature of the PHP language. I can move the web served directory to a separate directory that is not the root directory of the repo. This means the `uploads` folder is not in the webdir anymore which is better for several reasons. I can update different components to a major version (bootstrap, twig), use Webpack to deal better with the Javascripts, remove all the minified files from the git tracking. This means more work to install it without Docker, but the Docker method being the recommended one it's ok. It also means the repository is smaller and faster to clone. So basically with 2.0 I felt free to break everything and then rebuild it better after, without having to worry about anything (as long as I can write a proper upgrade documentation for non docker users!).

What changed?

.. warning:: This release contains TWO important changes! Read below.

* **IMPORTANT CHANGE N¬∞1**:

  * The `vendor` directory is not tracked by git anymore. This doesn't impact Docker users BUT THE OTHER POINT BELOW DOES. For git users, you now need to install `composer <https://getcomposer.org>`_. For this update, do like this:

  .. code-block:: bash

      cd /path/to/elabftw
      git pull
      rm -rf vendor # only for this time
      # see https://getcomposer.org to install composer
      composer install --no-dev

  Read the :ref:`new way to update here <how-to-update>`.

* **IMPORTANT CHANGE N¬∞2**:

  * The docker repo changed from elabftw/docker-elabftw to elabftw/elabimg. In order to get the latest version, make sure to edit /etc/elabftw.yml and change the line "image:"; replace "docker-elabftw" with "elabimg".

WARNING DOCKER USERS!!!!! IMPORTANT READ BELOW:

Once you pull the new version and visit a page, the config file will be updated with a new secret key. You need to copy it from inside the container to your docker-compose.yml file!

1. Use `docker ps` to check the ID of the container (or use its name)

2. Replace $ID from the below command with your container ID (or name). This command will extract the new key and place it at the end of your config file.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it $ID grep SECRET /elabftw/config.php| awk -F \' '{print $4}' >> docker-compose.yml

3. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to replace the old SECRET_KEY value by the new one at the end of the file.

Like shown on this image:

.. image:: img/1.2.1.png
    :align: center
    :alt: update config

For normal users (no docker):

If you have a message asking you to make your config file readable, use this: `chmod 777 config.php`. Execute this command from inside the `elabftw` folder.
Refresh the page to retry. You can put back restrictive permissions after the update is done.

This update is a major update from the php-encryption project. So we need to change how the key is. This key is used to encrypt the SMTP and timestamping passwords.

  * Timestamping with openssl has a bug! So we use Java.
