.. warning:: eLabFTW should be installed on a server, not a personal computer. Installing it on your personal computer is totally fine, but in the end, what you want is to install it on a server so everyone in your team (or institute/company) can benefit from it. See :ref:`install in the cloud<install-drop>` if you don't have a server.

Installing eLabFTW on Windows is not your typical Setup.exe > Next > Next > Finish install. Because it is a server software, we will run it on a server. And this server will be inside a container, run by `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_, which is itself run by GNU/Linux in a virtual machine. It might look complicated at first, but be not afraid, everything is explained.

Follow the steps below to install eLabFTW on your system:

#. Read the documentation and install `Docker Toolbox for Windows <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/>`_
#. `Download this configuration file template <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabimg/master/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE>`_
#. Save it as docker-compose.yml
#. Edit it with `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ or any editor you like but not plain old Notepad.
#. Read carefully the comments and edit what is needed
#. Save it as docker-compose.yml (make sure there is no .txt extension)
#. Open Docker Quickstart Terminal
#. Enter these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd Desktop #(or wherever you saved docker-compose.yml)
    docker-compose.exe up -d

**Final step** wait for the above command to finish. Then click here: https://192.168.99.100/

.. note:: Remember to keep your installation :doc:`backuped <backup>` and :doc:`updated <how-to-update>` ;)

.. note:: If you need to access eLabFTW from another computer, or if you installed it on a Windows server, you'll need to forward ports to the VirtualBox instance.
