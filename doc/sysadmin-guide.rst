Sysadmin guide
**************

General overview
================

The Sysadmin
------------
* Is the first registered user
* Has access to the Sysconfig Panel with general settings impacting every team hosted on the server
* Can create/edit/delete teams
* Can send a mass email to all users
* Can set the default language
* Can configure timestamping (if another TSA is wanted)
* Can change security settings (number of login attempts, manual validation of new users)
* It is possible to have multiple 'Sysadmin' accounts

Account creation
----------------
New users need to register an account on the register page, accessible from the login page. They need to choose a team from the list.

By default, newly created accounts are disabled. The admin of the team needs to validate them by going into the admin panel and activate new users.
This guide assumes you already have a working installation of eLabFTW on a server.
The Sysadmin has access to core settings of the eLabFTW instance like email configuration or security preferences.

Setting up email
================

If there is only one thing to do after an install, it's setting up email. Otherwise users will not be able to reset their password!

If a mail server is present, it will work out of the box. However, it is recommended to use an authenticated SMTP account to avoid the emails going to the spam folders of recipients. That is, unless your mail server is perfectly configured (with DKIM and SPF).

Go to the Sysadmin panel (a link is at the bottom left of a page) and add the requested infos.

If you don't know what to do, I highly recommend using `SMTP2GO <https://smtp2go.grsm.io/xj1zy4rvle6v>`_ (use this referral link), they provide a free plan that will probably be enough for your use case.

Register an account using this link: `SMTP2GO <https://smtp2go.grsm.io/xj1zy4rvle6v>`_. Once logged in, add an SMTP User: it will provide you with a login and password to connect to the SMTP server "mail.smtp2go.com". Input these credentials on the Sysadmin panel and test sending an email.

Set up backup
=============

See the :ref:`backup <backup>` page.

Set up the teams :sup:`(optional)`
===================================

The Sysadmin panel (`sysconfig.php`) allows you to add another team to your install. You should also edit your team name.

Configure authentication :sup:`(optional)`
==========================================

By default Users are authenticated locally, with their email and a password stored locally in eLabFTW.

You can chose to have other authentication mechanisms such as LDAP or SAMLv2 (IDP). They can be configured in their respective tabs. It is possible to have several mechanisms at the same time but recommended to only leave one visible to users. So if you configure LDAP or SAML, disable the Local login so Users are not confused.

Set up timestamping :sup:`(optional)`
======================================

eLabFTW provides an easy way to do `Trusted Timestamping <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping>`_ for your experiments, so you can have strong legal value for your lab notebook.

By default, it is setup to use `pki.dfn.de <https://www.pki.dfn.de/zeitstempeldienst/>`_ as :abbr:`TSA (TimeStampingAuthority)`. It is free for researchers. The only problem, is that they don't have ETSI certification for this service (although their PKI infrastructure is certified ETSI TS 102 042).

So if you need a stronger certification, you should go with a commercial solution providing an :rfc:`3161` way of timestamping documents. We recommend `Universign.com <https://www.universign.com>`_, as they are one of the most serious and recognized :abbr:`TSA (TimeStampingAuthority)` out there, but feel free to use the one you prefer.

You can select from the list of pre-configured TSA or use a custom one by providing the URL and login/password.

Remember: no data is sent to the `TSA (TimeStampingAuthority)`, only the hash of the data is sent, so no information can leak!

Configure storage :sup:`(optional)`
===================================

By default, uploaded files are stored in the `uploads/` folder that is mounted outside the container for persistance. You can choose instead to use an S3 compatible service (buckets) to store these files. The "Uploads" tab allows you to configure this storage.

To use S3 storage, set `ELAB_AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `ELAB_AWS_SECRET_KEY` in your config file.

Set up a cronjob to renew TLS certificates :sup:`(optional)`
=============================================================

If you installed it with a proper domain name and you used letsencrypt to get your TLS certificate, then you need to renew them every 3 months.

Create a script containing:

.. code-block:: bash

    # stop webserver
    elabctl stop
    # renew certificate
    certbot renew
    # and start the webserver again
    elabctl start

Add this script as a cronjob:

.. code-block:: bash

    0 4 1 * * /root/renew.sh

This line will run the script at 4am every 1st day of the month.

Update often
============

It is important to keep your install up to date with the latest bug fixes and new features.
